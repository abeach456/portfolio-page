# portfolio-page
This portfolio page is a certificate project from Free Code Camp. It employs the use of HTML5 and CSS.
It's fairly simple and straightforward, but it's also serving as a means for me to learn how to use GitHub & store code here.
I am including it here as I don't have any other "real" projects to share yet, but that will change soon!
